## ASSIGNMENT 1: JS FOR REACT NATIVE
## ID: 11210385

Here is a summary of the three tasks:

**TASK 1: Array Manipulation:**
This task involved creating a new JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js` and writing a function called `processArray`. The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

**TASK 2: String Formatting:**
For this task, an additional function called `formatArrayStrings` was added to the `arrayManipulation.js` file. This function takes two arrays as arguments - an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the `processArray` function. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number, capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

**TASK 3: User Profiles:**
In this task, a new file called `userInfo.js` was created, and a function called `createUserProfiles` was written. This function takes an array of names and an array of modified names from Task 2. The function then returns an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, and a unique ID that increases automatically.
